      <h1>About Krishi Saathi</h1>
      <p>
        Krishi Saathi is an AI-powered farming assistant developed as part of the
        Smart India Hackathon 2025. Our mission is to empower farmers with the
        right knowledge, tools, and insights so they can improve productivity,
        increase income, and practice sustainable agriculture.
      </p>
      <p>
        Farmers in India face challenges like limited access to real-time
        agricultural guidance, lack of technical knowledge, language barriers,
        and unpredictable weather and market fluctuations. Krishi Saathi
        addresses these challenges by providing crop recommendations, fertilizer
        guides, weather forecasts, market prices, and even a conversational chat
        assistant ‚Äî all in one platform.

  <section class="about-section features-now">
    <div class="about-container">
      <h2>üåü What We Are Doing Now</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Crop Recommendation:</strong> Suggests the best crops based on soil, pH, rainfall, and season.</li>
        <li><strong>Fertilizer Guide:</strong> Detailed usage instructions for each crop-fertilizer combination.</li>
        <li><strong>Weather & Market Dashboard:</strong> Mocked local forecasts and mandi prices for districts.</li>
        <li><strong>Chat Assistant:</strong> Farmers can ask queries in text/voice and get actionable responses.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These features together form a strong foundation for a decision support
        system for farmers. Even at the prototype stage, they demonstrate how AI
        can simplify agriculture for millions of smallholder farmers.

      <h2>üöÄ Our Future Vision</h2>
      <p>
        While our current prototype showcases the core functionality, our
        long-term vision is to scale Krishi Saathi into a comprehensive
        platform:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Real-time Data Integration:</strong> Use IoT soil sensors, satellite data (SoilGrids, Bhuvan APIs), and real mandi price APIs.</li>
        <li><strong>Crop Disease Detection:</strong> Farmers can upload pictures of crop leaves for instant AI-based diagnosis and treatment advice.</li>
        <li><strong>Multilingual Voice Support:</strong> Full support for Indian languages like Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, etc., with natural speech.</li>
        <li><strong>Offline Mode:</strong> Mobile app version that works in low-connectivity rural areas.</li>
        <li><strong>Market Linkages:</strong> Connect farmers directly with buyers, cooperatives, and agri-markets.</li>
        <li><strong>Community Forum:</strong> Peer-to-peer farmer knowledge sharing with expert validation.</li>
        <li><strong>Sustainability Features:</strong> Recommendations for crop rotation, organic fertilizers, and water-saving techniques.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our ultimate goal is to make Krishi Saathi not just a decision-support
        system but a trusted digital companion for every Indian farmer.
